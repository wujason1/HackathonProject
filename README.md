# GitLab Innovation Pitch Competition



## Work in Progress

In 2023, over 262,000 tech workers lost their jobs. In 2024, that number is currently at 32,496 as of February 5 and is expected to surpass 2023. One of the biggest challenges for those affected is staying motivated, especially in the current job market.

Work in Progress aims to gamify the job application process, keeping tech industry jobseekers in the US motivated with rewards. Our web app offers a series of challenges based around the job hunting process and career goals. As jobseekers complete these challenges, they unlock a variety of gift cards to their favorite stores or restaurants.

With Work in Progress, finding the next dream job will be more than a challenge. It will be an adventure filled with rewards and excitement.

## Installation
1. Fork the project and open it in your favorite IDE
2. Start the backend, by running HackathonProjectApplication. It can be found by going through src > main > java > HackathonProjectApplication
3. In your terminal, navigate to the frontend folder of the project
4. Run the command 'npm start'
5. You may need to run 'npm install' before 'npm start' if it is giving errors

## Chosen Technologies
### React
The team went with React for our front-end framework due to its efficiency and flexibility, especially for a project of this size. And the amount of documentation support for React was extremely helpful in our development process. 

### Bootstrap
We were initially torn between TailwindCSS and Bootstrap for the CSS framework, but went with Bootstrap due to finding more support and documentation.

### Spring Boot (Java)
The team has a lot of experience with Spring Boot and Java, making it the obvious choice for the backend framework.

## Obstacles
Getting the front and back end is usually the hardest part of a project. Learning React was another big learning curve as the team was more familiar with Angular.

## Assumptions
Due to timing, the web application was designed with computer users only in mind. The web app is not as mobile friendly as we would like.

## If there was time
We would have loved have added more challenges ranging from attending a career fair, share or post on LinkedIn, to attending workshops. And with more challenges, we could add a feature to personalize the challenges based on what the jobseeker is trying to do with their career. Also, it would have been nice to be able to create our own personalized art for the entire project outside the logo and about page background.

It would have also been helpful to take the time to perform some usability tests with potential users to get feedback on how we can improve UI and other features such as a profile page.

We would also add end-to-end testing, better security functionalities, and learn to incorporate some of the amazing DevOps tools GitLab has to offer.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Thank you, Erynn Ramos and Jason Wu for joining me on this project. You made the start of 2024 absolutely amazing. I enjoyed being able to work with both of you again. Whoever eventually hires you both will be extremely lucky to have you on their team. -Kira Sanford
