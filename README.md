# GitLab Innovation Pitch Competition



## Work in Progress

In 2023, over 262,000 tech workers lost their jobs. In 2024, that number is currently at 32,496 as of February 5 and is expected to surpass 2023. One of the biggest challenges for those affected is staying motivated, especially in the current job market.

Work in Progress aims to gamify the job application process, keeping tech industry job seekers in the US motivated with rewards. Our web app offers a series of challenges based around the job hunting process and career goals. As job seekers complete these challenges, they unlock a variety of gift cards to their favorite stores or restaurants.

With Work in Progress, finding the next dream job will be more than a challenge. It will be an adventure filled with rewards and excitement.

## Installation
Go over the process to set up and run the application as if the person has no idea what they are doing.

## Chosen Technologies
### React
The team went with React for our front-end framework due to its efficiency and flexibility, especially for a project of this size. And the amount of documentation support for React was extremely helpful in our development proccess. 

### Bootstrap
We were initially torn between TailwindCSS and Bootstrap for the CSS framework, but went with Bootstrap due to finding more support and documentation.

### Spring Boot (Java)
The team has a lot of experience with Spring Boot and Java, making it the obvious choice for the backend framework.

## Obstacles
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Assumptions
Due to timing, the web application was designed with computer users only in mind. The web app is not as mobile friendly as we would like.

## If there was time
If there was more time, we would have loved
